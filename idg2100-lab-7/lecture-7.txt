Web Components (reusable web components - state and props)
    HTML attributes aren't always a good solution to pass data to a web components 
        The value might be too long
        The value is a complex data type (JSON-style data structure, array, object, etc.)
        There might be a value you don't want to show in the HTML code (data is too sensitive)

    HTML properties might be better for passing complex data types
        Remember: DOM elements are also exposed in JS as objects
        How can we use properties?
            Using getters and setters in the component class
        Pros 
            Can work with complex data types including objects and arrays 
            Can be used to hide code from HTML
        Cons 
            Complexity
            Configuration relies on JS (can't be used as an out of the box HTML element)
