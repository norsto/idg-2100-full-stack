API (Application Programming Interface)

    A "contract between backend and frontend
    An agreement on how different parts of an application are to interact with each other
    JSON

    Traditional web apps 
    Each request returns a page.
    It has to request the page from a database every time you leave and come back to it

    SPA (single page application)
    Only the 1st request returns a page
    Most subsequent requests return some data to render or update the page
    APIs allow SPAs

    API terminology
    APIs are not always web-based, but most of the time when talking about APIs people mean web_based APIs
    Web APIs are not always REST or RESTful APIs, but most of the time when talking about APIs 
    people mean web-based RESTful APIs
    APIs are not SDKs(software developer kits); SKDs are more complete and may contain multiple APIs
    APIs are webservices but not all webservices are APIs

    API Basic Premise
    Expose the interface through an HTTP-based web server   
    APIs define a set of endpoints
    Clients call these endpoints HTTP requests
    The endpoints answer with an HTTP response (often JSON)

    Common API approaches

    REST (Represenrational State Transfer): 
    Asking for a resource
    Can return a resource in any format, but in practice often JSON
    has no formal way to define endpoints
    Relies on HTTP
    A resource is asked for by a combination of a URI and HTTP method
    methods often reffered to as vebs:
        GET to ask for a resource
        PUT to create a resource
        POST to modify a resource
        DELETE to delete a resource
    Examples:
        /api/users/{id}/posts
        /api/users/{id}/posts/{postID}
        /api/orders/{id}/items
        /api/products/{id}/reviews
        /api/categories/{id}/products

    SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
    calling method
    Precise endpoint description with WSDL(Wb Services Description Language), suitable for automatic code generation
    relies om XML
    Protocol agnostic

NodeJS

    A runtime environment that allows running JavaScript ...

    JavaScript runtime environment:
    Where your program will be executed

    Asyncronous:
    A non-blocking, architecture, so the execution of one task isn't dependent on another

    Event-driven:
    The dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces applications and network servers

    Non-blocking:
    A technique used to improve the responsiveness of an application by allowing it to perform 
    multiple I/O operations simultaneously without blocking

    Single threaded:
    The execution of code occurs sequentially, one instruction after another, within a single thread of execution

    Suitable for what situations?:
    Good for:
        Non-blocking
        Event-driven
        Data-intensive
        I/O intensive

    Less so for:
        comutation intensive uses

    NodeJS Advantages:
    Enables JS full-stack development (same language Front-end and Back-end)
    Front and back end are easier kept in sync
    ..
    ..
    ..

    Runnin NodeJS:
    either with CLI(Command Line Interface)
    or as scripts

    NodeJS Modules
    commonJs:
    const module = require("moduleNameOrPath");
    module.exports= {object};

    EMS modules (Engine Management System)
    Import module from "moduleNameOrPath";
    export{object};

    NodeJS Globals:
    Resemble the in-browser globals (e.g., setTimeout and console.log)
    Lack everything DOM and window-related
    __dirname
    __filename
    process

    Memory leak: 
    Occurs when a process allocates memory from the paged or nonpaged pool, but doesn't free the memory.
    An application asks for more memory, but doesn't release it back.

    NodeJS console:
        log
        warn
        error
        trace 
        assert
    (can style output with css??)

    NodeJS path 
    You put path.(join, resolve, normalize, etc); so ex. path.join

    join:
    used to join together path bits

    resolve:

    normalize:
    A function to "beautify" the path to a clean absolute path

    \ on Windows
    / on POSIX

    NodeJS fs (file system) 
        readFile
        writeFile
        access
        stat 
        readdir
        mkdir

    callbacks

    NodeJS HTTPS
        createServer
        request
        IncomingMessage
            for bigger requests/continous data streams(?)
        OutgoingMessage

    fetch is good for small requests

stacktrace:
A report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program
Like going through the layers of an onion from the centre out.

WebSocket:
The WebSocket object provide the API for creating and managing a WebSocket connection to a server, 
as well as for sending and recieving data on the connection
To construct a WebSocket, use the WebSocket() constructor
When you need to finish a transfer between the server?

http default port: 80
