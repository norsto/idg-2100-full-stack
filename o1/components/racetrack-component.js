Waits for the race-start event before allowing horses to move.
Tracks each horseâ€™s progress and detects when the first horse crosses the finish line.
Announces the winner and stops the race.
Slot Support:
<race-horse> components can be slotted inside <race-track> as children, allowing flexible horse management within the track.
Events:
race-finished: Emitted when a horse wins, with the payload containing the name of the winner's horse and any additional information needed.
