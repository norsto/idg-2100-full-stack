Start working in oblig two (I'm 1 hour late rip)

GET/quiz

how do you store the answers to the quiz 

Find a way to calculate the average (of how many got the correct answers)

Be able to show the final score 

Be able to identify sessions/users

    Storing info by index(?) or maybe not?
    Null paramater for unanswered questions 
        Takes up place in the db tho, so maybe not the best solution 

        Map it into the db (well)

"It looks very easy" it does not
